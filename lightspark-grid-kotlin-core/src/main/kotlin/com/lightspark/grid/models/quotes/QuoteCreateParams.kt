/**
 * Generate a quote for a cross-currency transfer between any combination of accounts and UMA
 * addresses. This endpoint handles currency exchange and provides the necessary instructions to
 * execute the transfer.
 *
 * **Transfer Types Supported:**
 * - **Account to Account**: Transfer between internal/external accounts with currency exchange.
 * - **Account to UMA**: Transfer from an internal account to an UMA address.
 * - **UMA to Account or UMA to UMA**: This transfer type will only be funded by payment
 *   instructions, not from an internal account.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Flexible Amount Locking**: Always specify whether you want to lock the sending amount or
 *   receiving amount
 * - **Currency Exchange**: Handles all cross-currency transfers with real-time exchange rates
 * - **Payment Instructions**: For UMA or customer ID sources, provides banking details needed for
 *   execution
 *
 * **Important:** If you are transferring funds in the same currency (no exchange required), use the
 * `/transfer-in` or `/transfer-out` endpoints instead.
 *
 * **Sandbox Testing:** When using the `externalAccountDetails` destination type in sandbox mode,
 * use account number patterns ending in specific digits to test different scenarios. These patterns
 * should be used with the primary alias, address, or identifier of whatever account type you're
 * testing. For example, the US account number, a CLABE, an IBAN, a spark wallet address, etc. The
 * failure patterns are:
 * - Account numbers ending in **002**: Insufficient funds (transfer-in will fail)
 * - Account numbers ending in **003**: Account closed/invalid (transfers will fail)
 * - Account numbers ending in **004**: Transfer rejected (bank rejects the transfer)
 * - Account numbers ending in **005**: Timeout/delayed failure (stays pending ~30s, then fails)
 * - Any other account number: Success (transfers complete normally)
